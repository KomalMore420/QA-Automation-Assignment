Testing Approach:

1)Requirements Analysis:
          Review the project requirements, user stories, and design specifications to understand the scope and functionality of the application.


2)Test Planning:

	Develop a test plan that outlines the testing objectives, scope, resources, and schedule.
	Identify the types of testing to be performed (e.g., functional, usability, performance).
	Define the testing environment, including browsers and devices.
	Determine the testing tools and frameworks to be used (e.g., TestCafe, Selenium, JUnit).


3) Test Case Design:

	Create detailed test cases for each functionality or feature of the application.
	Specify the test inputs, expected outcomes, and steps to reproduce.
	Categorize test cases into positive (valid) and negative (invalid) scenarios.

Test Cases:
	Test Case 1: Successful Login 
                  Input: Valid username and password
                  Expected Outcome: Redirect to the dashboard page

	Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Login - Invalid Credentials
                 Input: Invalid username and/or password
                 Expected Outcome: Display an error message


4)Test Execution:

	Execute test cases in the defined testing environment (e.g., Chrome and Firefox).
	Report test results, including pass/fail status and any defects found.
	Retest defects after they are fixed.
